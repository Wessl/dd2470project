Probably going to include procedural plant generation and placement

Easy mode: L system for plants, poisson disc sampling for procedural placement

Hard mode: "Synthetic Silviculture: Multi-scale Modeling of Plant Ecosystems" for both, OR the brazilian 2018 paper for placement combined with either L system generated plants or existing models
